# SkinSense Product Ingredient Classifier

### Overview
This notebook is a logic-only prototype tool for classifying skincare products—especially for people with eczema or damaged skin barriers. It estimates whether a formula is mostly a humectant, emollient, or occlusive, or a blend.  
### Purpose
The goal is to help users quickly interpret skincare formulas without relying on marketing claims. It supports sensitive-skin users and researchers exploring ingredient behavior.

### Structure
- `skincare_classifier.ipynb` — main notebook for logic testing  

### Usage
1. Open the notebook in Jupyter or Colab.  
2. Paste an ingredient list into the input cell.  
3. Run the logic cells to see classification output.

### Notes
- Add more ingredient categories (e.g., surfactants, preservatives).  
- Consider a future UI prototype for non-technical users.
